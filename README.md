5.1 If it has not be installed correction please redownload the folder and try all steps again.

Usage

1. To start using the scheduler, add the number of divisions you have in the league using the 'Add new Division' button. (Do Mens/Ladies Leagues in seperate program don't join together)

2. Then you can start adding clubs into the scheduler, the way the number of courts works is that it is the number of matches a club can host in one given night. For example a club with 2 courts may only be able to host 1 match a night so you would put the club having only 1 courts. However a club with 3 courts may be able to host 2 matches so you would put the club as having 2 courts and so on.

3. Then add all teams and assign them to correct clubs and division. You can then check all the details in edit menus.

4. If a court is closed for a given week this can be done through the 'Edit Schedule' button. However if to many courts are closed the scheduler may not be able to find a solution, so use with caution.

5. Leave button at bottom on 'Genetics Algorithm' side and press 'Run Scheduler'. Wait until the progress bar reaches 100% this may take some time. Once it reaches it should output an Excel file with the schedule into the 'Tennis-Scheduler' folder.

Notes
No club is allow to have more then two times the number of courts blocks.
You can save and open schedule infomation - this is good to store all club information so can be used for both Ladies and Men leagues.
